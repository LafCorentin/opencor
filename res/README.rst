Some information on the OpenCOR logo:

- |OpenCOR.svg|_: this was created from the original VPH logo, saving the resulting SVG file as an optimised SVG file (using `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_), and beautifying it using http://xmlbeautifier.com/.
- |logo.svg|_: this was created from |OpenCOR.svg|_ by converting the `OpenCOR` text to a path using `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_, making it possible for `QSvgWidget` to render it.
- |OpenCOR.pptx|_: this was created by using a screenshot version of |OpenCOR.svg|_, adding some space around it (e.g. ``50`` pixels), and making sure that it is square.
- ``OpenCOR``\ [\ |.ico|_\ \|\ |.png|_\ \|\ |.icns|_]: these were created by saving a 100% version of |OpenCOR.pptx|_ as a PNG file, using that PNG file as an input to http://iconverticons.com/online/, and downloading the corresponding ``.ico``, ``.png`` (the ``256x256`` pixel version) and ``.icns`` versions.
